1) Create a new project/app
2) Have the root route render the main Ninja Gold page
3) NINJA BONUS: Refactor your code so the location is being passed in the URL rather than via a form
4) SENSEI BONUS: Have the user specify the win conditions before starting, and then implement them in the game (# of moves, goal for gold)
5) Have the "/process-money" POST route increase/decrease the user's gold by an appropriate amount and redirect to the root route
