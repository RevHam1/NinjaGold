Create a simple game to test your understanding of flask, and implement the functionality below. For this assignment, you're going to create a mini-game that helps 
a ninja make some money! When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different 
amounts of gold. In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or LOSE up to 50 golds. Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to 
display past activities of this ninja. Guidelines

* Have /process_money determine how much gold the user should have.
